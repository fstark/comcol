A "vibe coded" Computer Collection

# Rationale

This is a sample application that I build with github co-pilot. I do not intent to every write one line of code manually, and this will be entirely created an maintained by co-pilot.

# Feedback

While have the basics running was extremenly quick, getting it to be somewhat stable proved an exercice in frustration. Breaking the needs into specific simple tasks is much more complex than it seems. The LLM never learns, and will hapilly completely undo something it did before. It has no ethical issue to bluitly lie to your face, or completely duplicate a functionality in a different place because it didn't found code it created 15 minutes earlier.

The quality of the code is all over the place. Sometimes it is correct, sometimes it is just god-awful. Correcting the code is not very useful, because it won't care on its next edit.

We live in interesting times...
