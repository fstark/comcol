This was the prompt:

create a django application on a sqlite3 database with a react frontend to manage a computer collection. the main entity is the computer, with a name, a maker, a year, a description and a series of pictures. The app is single user with a hard coded password. Unlogged users can look at the collection and search, while the admin user can edit the content of the collection.

Note: when you create a terminal, you need to run ``source venv/bin/activate`` in it.

We have now created the database and are trying to run the frontend.
